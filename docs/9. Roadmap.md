# Roadmap

## Backlog

* Enhance **DIY chart builder**
* Predefinied parameter settings for "strategies"
* API Endpoint for the optimization
* Alerting with Discord / Telegram
* Detailed Historical Performance (hourly intervalls with caching)
* Optimization of query fees (cobb-douglas-function)
* Predictive modelling of subgraph signals -> which subgraph will get additional signal
* Gas Optimization and Gas Estimation

## WIP
* Dockerizing the application
* Automatic allocation optimization and reallocation with cronjobs and communication with the indexe agent endpoint (requires graphQL mutations)
* Styling, Fixing Bugs and enhancing charts in the streamlit web application
* Running the optimization script on testnet.
* script_never.txt just populates the subgraphs that are reallocated, not removing all allocations
* script.txt just allocating the changed allocations
* Download performance data as .csv
